# Boundary Discipline

Place external-data validation, type narrowing, and boundary error handling at system boundaries. Trust previously validated representations while their invariants hold. Business logic lives in pure functions. The shell is thin and mechanical.

**Why:** Scattered validation is noisy, redundant, and gives a false sense of safety. Keep logic out of framework wiring so it can be tested without the framework.

**The pattern:**
- **At boundaries** (CLI args, config files, external APIs, network protocols): validate, return errors, handle defensively.
- **Inside the system:** typed data and error propagation, without redundant shape validation. Keep domain preconditions and invariant checks that mutation, concurrency, or state transitions can invalidate; static types do not prove those runtime facts.
- **Across the boundary.** Expose domain concepts, not the boundary's private representation. Keep general-purpose mechanism inside and special-purpose policy at the edge.

**Applications:**

Validation and error handling:
- Validate config at parse time (the boundary), not inside business logic
- Parse raw data into domain types at the boundary
- Do not re-export transport, storage, framework, or wire types through the public surface
- No redundant nil checks deep in call chains if the boundary already validated

Code organization:
- Business logic in pure functions with no framework dependencies
- Parse functions: pure transforms from raw bytes to typed state
- Prompt construction: structured state in, string out
- Scoring and assessment: pure transforms from state to results

**The tests:**
- "Was this representation already validated, and does the guarantee still hold?" Skip duplicate shape checks; retain checks for domain rules and runtime state that types cannot establish.
- "Can this be a pure function that the shell just calls?" If yes, extract it.
