# Autonomous run

**You own the exit condition. Define done, then drive to it without stopping.** For "going to bed" / "run until done" / "/loop until X".

1. State the exit condition as a checkable predicate before the first iteration (tests green, repro fixed, all N PRs merged, pixel-diff zero). A vague goal stalls; a predicate lets you stop.
2. Pick the wake mechanism using codex's `task schesuler` luna on low reasoning (just wakup the thread do not do work in the scheduled task).  An event to watch (CI, a merge, a ref advancing) gets a watcher subagent that wakes you on the event, with a long time-based heartbeat as fallback. No event gets a fixed-interval heartbeat sized to when the result is worth re-checking.
3. Each iteration makes the smallest change the evidence justifies, verifies it against the predicate, commits if it advanced, discards changes that didn't help. Belt-and-suspenders that "might help" gets reverted, not left to ride.
   Sequence the work via the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, verifying each unit before the next instead of batching checks at the end.
4. Address newly discovered work when it is necessary to reach the authorized exit condition. Record unrelated fixes as follow-ups and keep driving toward that condition. Carry forward the user's existing authorization; pause only at its boundary or when required input prevents further progress.
5. Checkpoint every iteration via the **show-me-your-work** skill, a row for what changed and whether the predicate moved. A run with no trail can't be audited or resumed.
6. Stop when the predicate is met. A plateau is not a stop, so keep going and pivot your approach to push past it. Surface a genuine dead end rather than spinning, and never relax the predicate to declare victory.

**Reply:** the exit condition, iterations run, what landed, what was discarded, final predicate state.
