# Steer with principle names

pstack ships 21 principles as individual skills. `/poteto-mode` reads a principle only when it resolves a concrete decision. The skills are explicit steering tools rather than a checklist every task must load.

Use a principle name when you want to steer the work. Each name points at a focused rule, so one phrase can redirect the work more precisely than a paragraph of instructions.

## Steering in practice

Say the agent is about to bolt a new adapter onto three existing ones:

```text
use subtract before you add. delete the obsolete adapters first, then design what's left.
```

Say it claims success because the build passed:

```text
apply prove it works. run the real import flow and show me the written records.
```

Say two parallel attempts are about to write to the same branch:

```text
separate before serializing shared state. give each attempt its own worktree, no locks.
```

Each phrase lands because the rule behind it is specific. Judge the result by the decision it changes, not by whether the final reply repeats the principle's name.

## The 21, briefly

The core principles decide how much to build and when to rethink the design:

- [Laziness Protocol](../../skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) prefers deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem.
- [Foundational Thinking](../../skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) chooses the core data structures before writing logic.
- [Redesign from First Principles](../../skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) integrates a new requirement as if it had been there from day one.
- [Subtract Before You Add](../../skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) removes dead weight before building on top of it.
- [Minimize Reader Load](../../skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) collapses layers and hidden state a reader must hold in their head.
- [Outcome-Oriented Execution](../../skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) converges rewrites on the target design instead of preserving throwaway compatibility states.
- [Experience First](../../skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) chooses the user's result over implementation convenience.
- [Exhaust the Design Space](../../skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) builds two or three competing prototypes when there's no precedent.
- [Build the Lever](../../skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) builds the script that does or proves the work, so a reviewer can rerun it.

The architecture principles decide where state, validation, and compatibility live:

- [Model the Domain](../../skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) encodes repeated rules in one structure, not scattered conditionals.
- [Boundary Discipline](../../skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) validates at the boundary and trusts internal types.
- [Type System Discipline](../../skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) makes illegal states unrepresentable.
- [Make Operations Idempotent](../../skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) converges retries on the same end state.
- [Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs](../../skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) migrates and deletes in one wave.
- [Separate Before Serializing Shared State](../../skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) removes the sharing before adding coordination.

The verification principles define what counts as proof:

- [Prove It Works](../../skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) verifies the real artifact, not a proxy.
- [Fix Root Causes](../../skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) reproduces and traces to the cause before changing code.
- [Sequence Work into Verifiable Units](../../skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) ends each small unit in a check before starting the next.

The delegation principles keep parallel work sane:

- [Guard the Context Window](../../skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) routes bulk reading to subagents and keeps findings in the main chat.
- [Never Block on the Human](../../skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) proceeds on reversible work and presents the result.

And one meta principle:

- [Encode Lessons in Structure](../../skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) turns advice you've repeated twice into a lint, check, or script.

Don't memorize the list. Skim it now, then come back when you catch the agent doing something a name here would have prevented. That's how the vocabulary sticks.
